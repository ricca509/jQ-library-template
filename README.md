What is jQ
--------------------------------------
jQ is a simple effort in creating a small library template that works as jQuery works.

How do you build a library that you call and use like jQuery?
```javascript
jQ('something').method1().method2();
```
This code does nothing but showing a way to structure a library in 'jQuery style'.
My target was to emulate that behaviour, I'm publishing the code in the hope it can be of help for someone.
