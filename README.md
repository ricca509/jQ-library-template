#jQ

**What**

jQ is a simple effort in creating a small library template that works as jQuery works.

This library answer the question: How do you build a library that you call and use like jQuery?

This code does nothing but showing a way to structure a library in 'jQuery style'.
My target was to emulate that behaviour, I'm publishing the code in the hope it can be of help for someone.

**Getting it**

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ricca509/jQ-library-template.git
```

**Using it**

```javascript
jQ('something').method1().method2();
```
